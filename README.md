# Scene Editor for MuJoCo

<p align="center">

</p>

Lightweight, interactive scene editor for [MuJoCo 3.x.](https://mujoco.org/) Create or edit scenes in
your browser to place shapes, import meshes, add robots, and edit elements interactively.


## Quickstart

```bash
pip install mujoco-scene-editor

# Start a fresh, empty scene
mjcreate

# Load from MJCF XML or a blueprint JSON
mjedit path/to/scene.xml
```


## Installation

Install the package on [PyPi](https://pypi.org/project/mujoco-scene-editor/) with

```bash
pip install mujoco-scene-editor
```
This installs necessary dependencies and exposes console scripts.
The following entry points are available and they are also accessible as `scene-editor` subcommands:
 - `mjcreate`: Create an empty scene (opens the web browser)
 - `mjedit`: Edit an existing scene (opens the web browser)
 - `mjprompt`: Generate a scene from a prompt and save it as a MuJoCo XML

From a local checkout:

```bash
pip install -e .
# or with dev tools
pip install -e '.[dev]'
```

To run with uv, use

```bash
# Run the installed console script via uv
uv run scene-editor --help
uv run scene-editor new
```

When the server starts, it prints the URL and opens your browser. Quit with Ctrl+C or the "Quit server" button.

## Examples

Use the provided chemistry lab MJCF as a starting point:

```bash
# With pip-installed package
mjedit examples/prompt/scene_chemistry_lab.xml

# With uv (no install)
uv run --with mujoco-scene-editor mjedit examples/prompt/scene_chemistry_lab.xml
```

Then:
- Use "Add Box/Sphere/Cylinder" to place primitive geoms.
- Use "Add Asset" to insert a local mesh from your file system.
- Drag the gizmo to change pose; use “Export” to write MJCF/JSON.

Robot models are detected using a heuristic. See the section below on how to configure the editor to use different robot models.


## Prompting / Scene Generation Examples

You can conveniently generate a MuJoCo scene from a natural-language prompt (requires an OpenRouter API key):

```bash
# Set this to your OpenRouter API key
export OPENROUTER_API_KEY=...
# Optional configuration
export OPENROUTER_MODEL=nvidia/nemotron-3-super-120b-a12b:free
# Optional: fallback models (comma-separated) tried automatically on
# rate-limit/provider errors or empty responses.
# export OPENROUTER_FALLBACK_MODELS=qwen/qwen3-next-80b-a3b-instruct:free,google/gemma-4-31b-it:free
# export OPENROUTER_HTTP_REFERER=https://your-app.example
# export OPENROUTER_X_TITLE=mujoco-scene-editor
# Generate a scene from a prompt string
mjprompt

# Or override the model for a single run
# mjprompt --model qwen/qwen3-next-80b-a3b-instruct:free

# Edit the generated scene. 
mjedit examples/prompt/scene_coffee_shop.xml
```
Loading a generated scene might not work out of the box in all cases. Generated scenes can have inconsistencies in geometry, but can be easily edited.

### Examples

Below are some generated example scenes. More examples are available in the `examples/prompt` folder.

## Working with different robots or cameras

Robot models must be specified with a JSON configuration.
To work with additional robot models, set the `ROBITS_CONFIG_DIR` environment variable to another config folder. See the [RoBits documentation](https://robits.ai/en/latest/configuration.html) for more details.

```bash
  export ROBITS_CONFIG_DIR=$HOME/code/robits/robits_config/additional_config_sim
  mjedit examples/prompt/scene_coffee_shop.xml
```


## Limitations

- Importing MuJoCo XML files may alter the internal structure, and some tags are discarded.
  - Joints/actuators are discarded if they are not part of a robot description.
  - Additional geom tags, including friction, conaffinity, or contype are not yet supported and discarded.
  - Light/option/compiler elements are not implemented yet.

If you are looking for a robot editor for MuJoCo that supports all the assets please checkout Robola web
  
- Not all MuJoCo robot descriptions have an equivalent URDF representation.
