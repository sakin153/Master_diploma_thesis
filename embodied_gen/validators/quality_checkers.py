            - If there are fewer than <return_num> distinct relevant matches, repeat the closest ones to make a list of <return_num>.
            - Only output the list of <return_num> scene IDs, sorted from most to less similar.
            - Do NOT use markdown, JSON code blocks, or any formatting syntax, only return a plain list like ["id1", ...].
            - The returned scene ID must exist in the dictionary and be in exactly the same format. For example,
                if the key in the dictionary is "scene_0040", return "scene_0040"; if it is "scene_040", return "scene_040".
